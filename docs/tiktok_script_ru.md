# TikTok Video Script (Russian)

A vertical 9:16 TikTok-style live-action video in Russian featuring a real person as the main character. The main character is a young male web developer from Moldova (about 20–25 years old), with a friendly, trustworthy look. He sits at a desk with a laptop, looks into the camera, gestures naturally, and shows website examples on his screen. The video is for local business owners in Moldova. No voiceover audio is required, but his mouth movements should roughly match speaking Russian, and there should be large readable Russian text on screen summarizing what he says.

## Overall style

- Realistic live-action, not cartoon.
- Natural daylight or soft warm lighting.
- Clean, minimal background (desk, plant, maybe a second monitor).
- On-screen Russian text must be big and easy to read on a phone.

## Scene 1 (0–4s) — INTRO

- **Shot:** Medium close-up of the web developer sitting at a desk with an open laptop.
- He looks into the camera, smiles slightly, and starts speaking, gesturing with one hand.
- **On-screen text in Russian:** "Привет! Я Денис, делаю сайты и лендинги для локальных бизнесов в Молдове."

## Scene 2 (4–8s) — WHO I WORK WITH

- Camera slowly zooms in a bit while he continues talking.
- On his laptop screen, we see quick slides of different businesses: a beauty salon, a cafe, a gym, a small local shop.
- **On-screen text in Russian:** "Салоны красоты, кафе, студии, фитнес, услуги и магазины."

## Scene 3 (8–13s) — PROBLEM

- Cut to an over-the-shoulder shot from behind him, showing his laptop screen.
- On screen: an Instagram profile and a Facebook page of a local business, full of posts but no proper website.
- He points at the screen with his finger or small hand gesture, as if explaining.
- **On-screen text in Russian:** "У многих только соцсети и номер телефона…"
- Then add a second line in Russian: "Клиенту сложно понять, что вы предлагаете и как записаться."

## Scene 4 (13–18s) — SOLUTION (MY WORK)

- Cut back to front view. The developer rotates the laptop slightly toward the camera to show a clean, modern landing page design.
- The landing shows: big headline, service cards, photos, and a clear button "Записаться".
- He points at the button on the screen and nods.
- **On-screen text in Russian:** "Я делаю простые современные лендинги под ваш бизнес."

---

## Scene 5 (18–23s) — WHAT EXACTLY I DO

- Close-up of the laptop screen, scrolling through a landing page: first screen, services, reviews, contacts.
- The developer's hand scrolls on the touchpad or touches the screen.
- **On-screen text in Russian:**
  - "Что входит:
  - – структура и дизайн,
  - – адаптив под телефон,
  - – запись через сайт → Telegram/WhatsApp."

---

## Scene 6 (23–27s) — I'M REAL, NOT A SCAM

- Medium shot again, the developer looks straight into the camera and speaks calmly, with open gestures (palms slightly visible).
- **On-screen text in Russian:** "Работаю по-честному и прозрачно, без навязчивых продаж."

---

## Scene 7 (27–32s) — CALL TO ACTION

- Same shot, he slightly leans closer to the camera and points with his finger downwards (as if to the TikTok description and link).
- **On-screen main text in Russian (center, large):** "Нужен лендинг или сайт для вашего бизнеса в Молдове?"
- **Second line in Russian:** "Смотрите примеры и цены на моём сайте:"
- **Third line in Russian:** "portfolio-wine-xi-60.vercel.app"
- **Fourth small line in Russian:** "Пиши в Telegram: @orlioglodenis24"
- He gives a final friendly nod or small wave.

## Important details

- The person should look like a real young web developer from Moldova, casual but neat clothing (simple t-shirt or hoodie, no suit).
- The video must feel personal and trustworthy, as if he is honestly explaining his services, not like an aggressive ad.
- Camera movements are smooth and subtle, no crazy effects.
- Russian text on screen is always large, high contrast (white on darker background or dark on light), easy to read on a smartphone.
